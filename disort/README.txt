This directory contains the source code for the DISORT radiative transfer
package, as well as the code for an IDL DLM, allowing DISORT to be called
directly from IDL.  See the README.txt file in src/ for more details on
building the IDL DLM.

An example of calling DISORT from IDL is given in the IDL programme
ExampleDISORT.pro. I suggest you make a copy of this file into your own working
directory and use it as the basis for your own IDL programme.

If you have any problems please contact Gareth Thomas, Greg McGarragh, or the
ORAC developers email mailing list at: devorac@jiscmail.ac.uk.
